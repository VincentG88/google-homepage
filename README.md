I deconstructed Google's homepage and rebuilt it using a combination of HTML and CSS. 

As this was my first serious attempt at building a webpage I spend some minutes staring at a blank page in VSCode.
After contemplating some life choices I slowly started to go through the things that I had learned by completing the FCC Reponsive Web Design course.

I was able to set up the basic structure of the HTML fairly quick. Dividing the page into a number of divs definitely helped my progress and, even though I had to use Google quite a bit, I made good progress with the navbar, logo and search bar. 

The real trick was figuring out the CSS. This took me hours and after a lot of tweaking with margins, padding and grid areas(!) I finally managed to design a page that looks pretty similar to Google's actual homepage. As much as I wanted to avoid the Devtools, I did use them to get accurate colours (sign in, footer, buttons) and borders (sign in,search bar, buttons, footer)

I believe that my struggles in the first part of the assignment defintely were invaluable as progress in the end seemed to flow better as I was working on the footer. 

I learned a lot. On to the next one!
